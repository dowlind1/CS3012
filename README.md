# Lowest Common Ancestor

### Explanation of the LCA
The lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes v and w in a tree is the lowest node that has both v and w as descendants

Some of the tests I am going to be looking for:

### Tests
1. Check for the Lowest Common Ancestory

2. Test the constructor

3. Test a null tree

4. Test a small tree(at least 2 nodes - including root)

3. Test same node/elements for LCA

5. Test for non existing nodes in tree

The tests have been built and time to construct the code to implement the LCA
